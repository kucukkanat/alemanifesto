features:
  - title: 🍺🍻 Accessible
    details: |
      - A document must be searchable. <br/>
      - A document should be accessible to everyone with just a click. <br/>
      - A document should be comprehensible to readers from various disciplines. <br/>
      - Navigation through the document should be straightforward. <br/>
      - Avoid linking too much. When you link to another document then it is hidden content.[*](#thanks)
  - title: 🍺🍻 Living
    details: |
      - Outdated documentation is worse than having no documentation. <br/>
      - Make updating the document a **natural** part of your process. <br/>
      - Regularly review and revise the content for accuracy and relevance. <br/>
      - Establish a timeline for document audits to keep information current. <br/>
      - Use version control to track changes and updates effectively. <br/>
  - title: 🍺🍻 Easy To Contribute
    details: |
      Maintaining well-crafted documentation is challenging. Achieving quality, accessibility, and up-to-date information is easier through good collaboration. <br/>
      - Opt for a widely-used format; Markdown is recommended for its flexibility and portability. <br/>
      - Enable contributions from not just maintainers, but also readers, to enrich the documentation. <br/>
